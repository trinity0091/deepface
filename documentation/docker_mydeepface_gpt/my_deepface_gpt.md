How to create a  service API for below requirement using deepface project   "https://github.com/serengil/deepface" 
1. service API for add new  face along with name in to database
2. service API for match user image with existing database
3. Create a dockerfile(s) for the above service ( and database if required ). 

Explain all the steps in details

Ref:
 deepface project url "https://github.com/serengil/deepface" 

Note:
Database must be free
all service (database and api service  ) must be running in docker









Creating a service API for face recognition using the DeepFace project involves a few steps: setting up the environment, creating the API endpoints, and Dockerizing the application. Here's a detailed guide on how to achieve this:

### Step 1: Set Up Environment

1. **Clone DeepFace Project:**
   Clone the DeepFace project repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/serengil/deepface.git
   cd deepface
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install the required Python dependencies using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create API Directory:**
   Create a directory for your API code within the cloned DeepFace project:

   ```bash
   mkdir api
   cd api
   ```

4. **Install Flask:**
   Install Flask, a web framework for creating APIs:

   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

### Step 2: Implement API Endpoints

In this step, you'll create Python scripts to implement the API endpoints for adding a new face to the database and matching a user's image with the existing database.

1. **Add a New Face to the Database:**

   Create a Python script named `add_face.py` inside the `api` directory:

   ```python
   from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
   from deepface import DeepFace

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/add_face', methods=['POST'])
   def add_face():
       data = request.json
       name = data['name']
       image_url = data['image_url']

       # Perform face embedding using DeepFace
       embedding = DeepFace.represent(image_url, model_name='VGG-Face')

       # Store the embedding and name in your database (e.g., SQLite or MySQL)

       return jsonify({'message': 'Face added successfully'})

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
   ```

2. **Match User Image with Existing Database:**

   Create a Python script named `match_face.py` inside the `api` directory:

   ```python
   from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
   from deepface import DeepFace

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/match_face', methods=['POST'])
   def match_face():
       data = request.json
       image_url = data['image_url']

       # Perform face recognition using DeepFace
       result = DeepFace.verify(image_url, model_name='VGG-Face')

       # Check the result to determine if the image matches any existing face

       return jsonify({'is_match': result['verified']})

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
   ```

### Step 3: Create Dockerfile

Create a `Dockerfile` inside the `api` directory to containerize your API application:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt

# Make port 5000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 5000

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "add_face.py"]
```

Repeat the same process for the `match_face.py` script, changing the `CMD` line accordingly.

### Step 4: Build and Run Docker Containers

1. **Build Docker Image:**
   Navigate to the `api` directory and build the Docker image for each API:

   ```bash
   docker build -t add_face_api .
   docker build -t match_face_api -f Dockerfile.match .
   ```

2. **Run Docker Containers:**
   Run the Docker containers for both APIs:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 add_face_api
   docker run -d -p 5001:5000 match_face_api
   ```

Now, you have two API services running in separate Docker containers: one for adding faces to the database and another for matching user images.

Please note that this guide provides a high-level overview of the steps involved. You may need to adapt and refine the code and configurations based on your specific requirements and database setup. Additionally, the DeepFace library may have undergone updates since my knowledge cutoff date, so you should refer to its documentation for the latest information.
